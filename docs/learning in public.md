![[&the impulse to keep to yourself]]

something that can make learning difficult for me is the process of finding learning materials and setting up routines to consistently study. what would make it easier is if i could see somebody else's learning path. i'm hoping to make this a space where i can share what i'm learning and how i'm learning it.

- people learn better from those of similar skill level
- people learn better from watching others struggle with a task, rather than watching a pro at their craft
