the most important part of [[language learning]] is the input. you input target-language content into your eyeballs and earballs, and you [[active study in language learning|study]] from that content.

## active immersion

the 'active' in active immersion refers to actively taking in the content. this is not background music or a podcast while you're doing something else. this is referring to focusing on the content that you are reading and/or watching.

this can get difficult because trying to focus on something that you don't understand can be a pain. especially when you are aware that you could be reading/watching something that you do understand.

>rewatching or rereading something you've already seen or read in your natural language can help you stay engaged.

## passive listening

passive listening refers to listening to content while you're doing something else. this can be podcasts, music, or audiobooks typically.

passive listening will not help you understanding the language as well as active immersion can, but it can help you recognize the sounds of the language.
