## algebra

- from arabic, *al-jabr*
	- "reunion of broken parts" or "consolidation"
	- the same word 'algebra' was used in old english to mean 'bone-setting'
- i'm skipping algebra i and going right to algebra ii
	- i've taken both; algebra i seems very basic, but i think i need a review of algebra ii
