## hello, my name is nemo

these are my personal notes from a wide range of topics. as such they are messy and probably inaccurate at times.

## intentions

sharing is caring

- the main reason for these public notes is to share what i'm learning at the moment

perfectionism

- i struggle a lot with perfectionism and it often forces me to avoid doing the things that i'd like to do

motivation/accountability

- by moving my notes online, i'm hoping that it will motivate me to write more often

## how this site is built

- [template that i used](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs)
	- [...that uses mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
		- [...with the material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- [tutorial for setting up a custom domain from google with github pages](https://trentyang.com/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages/)
