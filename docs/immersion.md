## active immersion

active immersion is the most important part of learning a language

the 'active' in active immersion refers to actively paying attention to the content. this is not background music or a podcast while you're doing something else. this is focusing on the content that you are reading and/or watching.

this can get difficult because trying to focus on something that you don't understand can be a pain. especially when you are aware that you could be reading/watching something that you do understand.

> rewatching or rereading something you've already seen or read in your native language can help you stay engaged.

> it can be really helpful to listen while you're reading too!
>
> i like to listen to an audiobook while i'm reading the same book ([[español#reading (and listening along)]]), for instance.

it is recommended that you try to incorporate both intensive and free flow immersion.

### intensive

looking up every word so that you understand as much as possible. this can be great for learning vocab and grammar.

i say 'as much as possible' because even if you know the definition of every word of a sentence, you may still not understand the overall meaning of the sentence. that's okay, just skip that sentence!

> i am reminded that when i was a kid watching cartoons in my native language, i still didn't necessarily understand all the jokes and references until i was older. try to be okay with not getting it yet!

### free flow

free flow is great for acquisition ([[=language learning#language acquisition theory]]). instead of pausing the immersion, you just let your brain process as it comes.

## passive immersion

passive listening refers to listening to content while you're doing something else. this can be podcasts, music, or audiobooks typically.

passive listening will not help you understanding the language as well as active immersion can, but it can help you recognize the sounds of the language.

try to get in at least 30 minutes a day of passive listening

> i listen to a podcast ([[español#listening]]) while doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen. it usually adds up to around 30 minutes.
