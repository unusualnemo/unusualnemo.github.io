## evolution of homo sapiens

- 50 tya - language development
- 70-100 tya - migration from africa begins
- [[hominids]]
- 2.5 mya - [[paranthropus aethiopicus]]
- 2.3 mya - *homo habilis*
	- hominids' brain capacities increased
	- began to use simple tools
- (2 mya-700 tya) - *homo erectus*
	- along with other hominids, began to migrate out of africa and into eurasia
	- [[ability to control fire]]
- 130 tya - *homo sapiens*
- theory about why early hominids evolved - [[savannah hypothesis]]
- why didn't other hominids survive too?
	- *homo sapiens* are the only hominid left
	- theories
		- inability to cope with competition for food
		- changes in climate
		- volcanic eruptions

## homo sapiens' migration across earth

- 70-100 tya - homo sapiens migrating from africa into europe and asia
- 35-65 tya - reached australia by canoe
- 13 tya - pleistocene ice age created a land bridge between asia and north america that people crossed to get to the americas
- depletion of resources and competition probably drove people to migrate from africa
- language probably helped us plan and coordinate migrations as well

## adaptation and effects on nature

- moving from warm climate to cold climate really quickly, we had to adapt real fast
	- clothing out of animal skins
	- making fires to keep warm
- weapon making to kill large mammals
	- extinction of giant land mammals
		- mammoth
		- giant kangaroo
		- mastodons
- semi-permanent settlements
	- shifting from nomadic to fixed homes
	- beginnings of establishing communities and agricultural practices
