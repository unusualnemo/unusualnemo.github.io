## algebra

### binomial

$2x^2+1$

$$
2x^2+1
$$

- 2 terms
- exponent must be a non-negative integer
- (also: trinomial, quartic, quintic, etc...)

### polynomial

$$
2x^2+3x-4
$$

- terms are separated by pluses and minuses
	- comprised of coefficients, variables, and exponents
- the *degree* of the polynomial refers to the biggest exponent
- the *leading coefficient* is the coefficient in front of the biggest exponent
- exponents must be non-negative integers
