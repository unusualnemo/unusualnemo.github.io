## initial thoughts

> i remember learning this in high school, but it didn't really stick
>
> i think i had issues because there doesn't seem to be any real-world applications for this
>
> i may be wrong, but i think this exists because there exist roadblocks in some other branches of math and $i$ and $i^2$ help to cancel out $\sqrt{-1}$

## imaginary unit

$$
i = \sqrt{-1}
$$

$$
i^2 = -1
$$

above: this is the crux of complex numbers

| $i^x$ | equals |
| ----- | ------ |
| $i^0$ | $1$    |
| $i^1$ | $i$    |
| $i^2$ | $-1$   |
| $i^3$ | $-i$   |
| $i^4$ | $1$    |
| $i^5$ | $i$    |
| $i^6$ | $-1$   |
| $i^7$ | $-i$   |

- if the exponent is even, it is equal to $1$ or $-1$
- if the exponent is odd, it is equal to $i$ or $-i$

## simplifying

- *pure imaginary numbers* take the form $bi$ where $b$ is a nonzero real number
- examples:
	- $3i$
	- $i\sqrt{5}$
	- $-12i$

$$
\sqrt{-9} = \sqrt{-1} \cdot \sqrt{9} = i \cdot 3
$$

| simplified  | unsimplified   |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| $3i$        | $\sqrt{-9}$    |
| $i\sqrt{5}$ | $\sqrt{-5}$    |
| $-12i$      | $-\sqrt{-144}$ |
