## how does it work

### active recall

also known as retrieval practice or practice testing.

based on the testing effect that suggests that memories are strengthened when you successfully retrieve info from your memory.

the most popular study method of students is rereading the text, but it's not enough to passive intake the information and feel like you recognize it.

it reminds me of working out, signaling to your body that you'll need these muscles later. active recall seems to signal to the brain that you'll need this info later.

### the forgetting curve

information learned is quickly forgotten if it is not studied

### spaced repetition

if you practice active recall regularly with the information, it strengthens the durability of the memory more each time you recall it

the intervals don't have to be evenly split up. newer information must be recalled sooner, but older information doesn't have to be recalled very often.

### desirable difficulty

the harder it is to recall the information, the more the that memory is strengthened. therefore it is not only more time-efficient to space out your active recall, but it is also desirable for the durability of the memory.

## language learning

### 1k-2k deck

this gives you a good foundation of known words, but the meaning of sentences will still be vague, that's expected

there are many premade frequency decks for anki. you really shouldn't pay money for this deck; there are so many great options.

you can stop learning these whenever you catch up to it in your [[immersion#active immersion]], then switch to [[flashcards#sentence mining]]

### sentence mining

this deck is made by you by taking sentences out of your [[immersion#active immersion]] and making them into flashcards.

the card should look something like this...

> Me gustan las ==**carreras**== de caballos.
> --
> I like horse ==**races**==.

... with one unknown word bolded and/or highlighted in the target-language sentence, as well as the corresponding native-language sentence.

that one, highlighted word is the word you'll be studying.

pick easy words:

- prioritize words that feel familiar
	- when you keep seeing the same words again and again, that's a good indicator that they are common and therefore useful
	- a lot of the time your [[immersion]] material will use the same words over and over depending on the genre/themes
- choose words that seem accessible and useful
	- choose concrete words over words with abstract/vague definitions
- prioritize words that are relevant to you
	- these will be easier to memorize and more useful whenever you start using them

pick easy sentences:

- prioritize straightforward sentences with simple grammar
- prioritize sentences in which you know most of the words
	- preferably you will know all but one word, the word that you are studying from the card
- you don't have to use the entire sentence; you can break it into a smaller complete phrase
