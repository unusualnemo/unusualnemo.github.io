[tutorial on setting up anki for language learning on refold ->](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/a/anki-setup)

## language learning

### 1k-2k deck

this gives you a good foundation of known words, but the meaning of sentences will still be vague, that's expected

there are many premade frequency decks for anki. you really shouldn't pay money for this deck; there are so many great options.

you can stop learning these whenever you catch up to it in your [[immersion#active immersion|active immersion]], then switch to [[flashcards#sentence mining|sentence mining]]

### sentence mining

this deck is made by you by taking sentences out of your [[immersion#active immersion|active immersion]] and making them into flashcards.

the card should look something like this...

> Me gustan las ==**carreras**== de caballos.
> --
> I like horse ==**races**==.

... with one unknown word bolded and/or highlighted in the target-language sentence, as well as the corresponding natural-language sentence.

that one, highlighted word is the word you'll be studying.

pick easy words:

- prioritize words that feel familiar
	- when you keep seeing the same words again and again, that's a good indicator that they are common and therefore useful
	- a lot of the time your [[immersion]] material will use the same words over and over depending on the genre/themes
- choose words that seem accessible and useful
	- choose concrete words over words with abstract/vague definitions
- prioritize words that are relevant to you
	- these will be easier to memorize and more useful whenever you start using them

pick easy sentences:

- prioritize straightforward sentences with simple grammar
- prioritize sentences in which you know most of the words
	- preferably you will know all but one word, the word that you are studying from the card
- you don't have to use the entire sentence; you can break it into a smaller complete phrase
