- last ice age
	- started 110 tya
	- ended 15 tya
- agriculture 10-15 tya
- hunter-gatherer global pop capacity: 12 million people
- agriculture was developed independently all over the world

---

- began about 9000 bce
	- polished stone tools developed
	- last ice age ended
- why?
	- surplus in production
	- not everyone had to be focused on food production
	- specialization of labor

## prior to

- 200-300 tya - modern humans existed
- 15-20 tya - no evidence of agriculture
- 10 tya - pop was around 6-10 million
	- 100 pop tribe would need 50-500 sq km
	- lush places like rainforests could support more
	- the earth could only support 10 million people

## birth of

- 10-15 tya - agriculture emerges from multiple locations
	- mesopotamia, china, south america, sub-saharan africa
	- we will likely find more evidence of more places agriculture emerged earlier
- agricultural revolution - sometimes also called neolithic revolution
	- coincides with neolithic period
	- [[&neolithic]]
		- stone artifacts were more smooth and refined
		- these tools facilitated agriculture
- beginning agriculture
	- cultivating wild plants
	- basic herding of livestock

## why and where?

- end of ice age
	- the last ice age started 110 tya, ended 15 tya
	- this coincides with emergence of agriculture
	- after ice age
		- more humidity
		- less frozen soil
		- better conditions for plants and animals
	- problems
		- why haven't we found evidence of agriculture during the last warm period?
		- even during an ice age, there still would have been places in the tropics suitable for agriculture
- or, maybe we were (and are) more developed since last warm period
	- better:
		- brains?
		- language?
		- culture?
	- agriculture coincides with neolithic, with better tools, which supports the idea that 'better tech/culture = agriculture'

## pastoralism

- branch of agriculture
	- began same time as cultivation of plants
- the domestication and herding of animals (goats, sheep, cattle)
- in some places, cultivation of plants is difficult or impossible
	- rocky places
		- like iceland -> with all their sheep
	- shitty climates
- nomadic
	- but still less dependent on the environment to get resources
- resources:
	- meat
	- milk
	- wool
	- hides
- could trade with agricultural societies if they lived nearby
- but, sometimes they fought
