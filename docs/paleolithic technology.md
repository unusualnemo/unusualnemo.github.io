- stone tools are possibly the first cultural artifacts that historians can study
- the names of the paleolithic periods are based on the progression of tools
	- lower paleolithic
	- upper paleolithic
	- mesolithic (middle stone age)
	- neolithic (new stone age)
- tools can give us insight into culture
	- cave art depicts group hunting
		- therefore, paleolithic people probably hunted, foraged, and had a communal system for dividing labor and resources - you can also draw analogies to modern hunter-gatherer groups
- 40 tya
	- tools start to appear
		- narrow stone blades
		- tools made of bone, ivory, and antler
		- wood instruments
- 20 tya
	- first needles
- 17 - 8 tya
	- more complicated tools
		- barbed harpoons

	- [[Ã¶tzi, the iceman]] was a guy that got froze with his tools, including some of the more delicate ones
- development/progression of tools
	- tools start getting smaller, more detailed, more specialized (microliths in composite tools)
		- 35-25 tya - [[hand axes]] -> spear points in spears ([[paleolithic spears]])
			- makes hunting less dangerous - more food, more people
			- [[hand axes]] are the longest-used tool in human history
			- [[paleolithic spears]]
				- composite tool
				- microlith
- [[paleolithic architecture]]
