## basic stuff

### integers

- all whole numbers
	- includes positive and negative numbers
	- includes zero
	- not fractions

### irrational number

- number that cannot be represented as a decimal or fraction

### mixed numbers

- whole numbers mixed with fractions or decimals

### natural numbers

- non-negative, whole numbers
- sometimes includes zero, sometimes doesn't

### denominator and numerator

- numerator - top number in a fraction
- denominator - bottom number in a fraction

### proper fraction

- a fraction whose denominator is greater than its numerator

### simplifying radicals

$$
\sqrt{44} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{11} = 2\sqrt{11}
$$

### whole number

- positive integer

## algebra

### binomial

$2x^2+1$

$$
2x^2+1
$$

- 2 terms
- exponent must be a non-negative integer
- (also: trinomial, quartic, quintic, etc...)

### polynomial

$$
2x^2+3x-4
$$

- terms are separated by pluses and minuses
	- comprised of coefficients, variables, and exponents
- the *degree* of the polynomial refers to the biggest exponent
- the *leading coefficient* is the coefficient in front of the biggest exponent
- exponents must be non-negative integers
