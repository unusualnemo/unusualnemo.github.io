studying shouldn't be your first priority of [[learning a language]], [[immersion|immersion]] should be

## writing system and pronunciation

this is the stuff study that you do once at the beginning and then (hopefully) never again

studying the writing system isn't relevant to some language learning. the two languages i've been learning, [[español]] and français don't use different letters, unless you count stuff like 'ñ', 'ç', 'û', etc.

in some languages it's gonna be a little harder, i.e. greek or cyrillic. in some languages it's gonna be really difficult, i.e. mandarin or japanese.

pronunciation has been so easy when it comes to learning [[español]] and so difficult when learning français.

remember to pay attention to any punctuation and how they alter the sounds of words and if your target language has features like pitch accents or stress accents.

## grammar

the bare minimum (at least for something like a romance language or similar) is:

- to understand how to tell the subject, verb, and object apart
- to understand conjugation enough to begin to pick out verb tenses.

> spend as little time as you need to on grammar

for continued grammar study see: [[grammar study]]

## vocab

### most common 1000-2000 words

use [[flashcards in language learning|flashcards]] to learn the 1000-2000 most frequent words through flashcards

this is to give you a good foundation of known words, but the meaning of sentences will still be vague, that's expected

you can stop learning these whenever you catch up to it in your [[immersion#active|active immersion]], then switch to sentence mining
