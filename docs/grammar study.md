look up grammar on a need-to-know basis. if you haven't seen a rule before, you can't be sure that this it's a common enough rule to spend time on.

also your brain will have an easier time figuring out grammar if you have actual context behind it (rather than memorizing tables of abstract rules).

> another interest of mine is looking into language trees and how languages related to one another, why they differ and where they are similar. so some study of grammar is exceptionally interesting to me.

if you, like most people, think grammar is very boring, you don't have to study it a whole lot.
