## hate

- i really dislike the idea of the cynical genius
	- it seems to stem from 'ignorance is bliss' so therefore knowing is painful
	- the trope of the genius who's also a jerk
		- tony stark from 'iron man'
		- rick from 'rick and morty'
	- i wonder if our mythologies around ceos have something to do with this?
		- the idea of the cold, asshole, 'genius' ceo, like tony stark

## love

- my opinion is that, of course, understanding leads to love!
	- it is ignorance and fear that manifest hatred, and understanding is the cure
	- that's how it works in relationships
		- the more you know your partner, the more you love them
- if understanding only led to hate, what would be the point in understanding anything?
- a media example is 'ender's game' and 'speaker of the dead'
	- *"i think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves." - ender's game*
	- *"when you really know somebody you can’t hate them. or maybe it’s just that you can’t really know them until you stop hating them." - speaker for the dead*
	- (ironically enough these were written by a bigot; and i have trouble understanding how you could so adamantly choose to hate, choose to not understanding if this was really your worldview?)
		- *"'Ender’s Game' is set more than a century in the future and has nothing to do with political issues that did not exist when the book was written in 1984… It will be interesting to see whether the victorious proponents of gay marriage will show tolerance toward those who disagreed with them when the issue was still in dispute." - orson scott card calling his most popular book dated and irrelevant, while thinking that gay people didn't exist in 1984.*
