## language acquisition theory

'acquiring' language is different from 'studying' a language. this method of acquiring a language tries to copy how most people learned their first language:

> get as much comprehensible input as possible and let your brain do the pattern recognition that it's so good at.

the biggest obstacle to this method is being able to be okay with not understanding what you're watching or reading. it can be very frustrating feeling so lost and even feel like you're not making any progress. but the key thing is to trust your brain to do what it knows how to do. your brain *will* see the patterns and little by little you will be able to consciously notice more and more.

the major difference that this method has to other methods of learning a language is that there is zero emphasis on attempting to speak the language.

> my personal opinion is to speak as much as is fun for you. if you naturally translate in your head, go ahead! don't worry about breaking those rules. i find that the more flashcards i do, the more i start associating things in my every day with the language that i'm learning.
>
> i find that speaking a little can also be motivating. it really sucks to be studying a language for a while and still not be able to say even the simplest things in that language. speaking a little and being able to communicate something with someone can also signal to the brain that what you're learning is useful and can help you focus on it when you need to.
