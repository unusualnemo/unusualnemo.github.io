studying shouldn't be your first priority of [[language learning]], [[types of immersion|immersion]] should be

## writing system and pronunciation

this is the stuff study that you do once at the beginning and then (hopefully) never again

studying the writing system isn't relevant to some language learning. the two languages i've been learning, [[español]] and [[français]] don't use different letters, unless you count stuff like 'ñ', 'ç', 'û', etc.

in some languages it's gonna be a little harder, i.e. greek or cyrillic. in some languages it's gonna be really difficult, i.e. mandarin or japanese.

pronunciation has been so easy when it comes to learning [[español]] and so difficult when learning [[français]].

remember to pay attention to any punctuation and how they alter the sounds of words and if your target language has features like pitch accents or stress accents.

## grammar

look up grammar on a need-to-know basis. if you haven't seen a rule before, you can't be sure that this it's a common enough rule to spend time on.

also your brain will have an easier time figuring out grammar if you have actual context behind it (rather than memorizing tables of abstract rules).

> another interest of mine is looking into language trees and how languages related to one another, why they differ and where they are similar. so some study of grammar is exceptionally interesting to me.

if you, like most people, think grammar is very boring, you don't have to study it a whole lot.

the bare minimum (at least for something like a romance language or similar) is:

- to understand how to tell the subject, verb, and object apart
- to understand conjugation enough to begin to pick out verb tenses.

> spend as little time as you need to on grammar.

## vocab

### most common 1000-2000 words

use [[active recall and spaced repetition]] to learn the 1000-2000 most frequent words through flashcards

this is to give you a good foundation of known words, but the meaning of sentences will still be vague, that's expected

you can stop learning these whenever you catch up to it in your [[types of immersion#active immersion|active immersion]], then switch to sentence mining

### sentence mining

take sentences out of your [[types of immersion#active immersion|active immersion]] and make them into flashcards

the card should look something like this...

> Me gustan las ==**carreras**== de caballos.
> --
> I like horse ==**races**==.

... with one unknown word bolded and/or highlighted in the target-language sentence, as well as the corresponding natural-language sentence.

that one, highlighted word is the word you'll be studying

#### picking words and sentences

pick easy words:

- prioritize words that feel familiar
	- when you keep seeing the same words again and again, that's a good indicator that they are common and therefore useful
	- a lot of the time your immersion material will use the same words over and over depending on the genre/themes
- choose words that seem accessible and useful
	- choose concrete words over words with abstract/vague definitions
- prioritize words that are relevant to you
	- these will be easier to memorize and more useful whenever you start using them

pick easy sentences:

- prioritize straightforward sentences with simple grammar
- prioritize sentences in which you know most of the words
	- preferably you will know all but one word, the word that you are studying from the card
