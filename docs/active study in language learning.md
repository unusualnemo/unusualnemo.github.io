studying shouldn't be your first priority of [[language learning]], [[types of immersion|immersion]] should be

## writing system

this isn't relevant to some languages. the two languages i've been learning, [[español]] and [[français]] don't use different letters, unless you count stuff like 'ñ', 'ç', 'û', etc.

in some languages it's gonna be a little harder, i.e. greek or cyrillic. in some languages it's gonna be really difficult, i.e. mandarin or japanese.

## pronunciation

this has been so easy when it comes to learning [[español]] and so difficult when learning [[français]].

remember to pay attention to any puncuation and how they alter the sounds of words and if your target language has features like pitch accents or stress accents.

## grammar

look up grammar on a need-to-know basis. if you haven't seen a rule before, you can't be sure that this it's a common enough rule to spend time on.

also your brain will have an easier time figuring out grammar if you have actual context behind it (rather than memorizing tables of abstract rules).

> another interest of mine is looking into language trees and how languages related to one another, why they differ and where they are similar. so some study of grammar is exceptionally interesting to me.

if you, like most people, think grammar is very boring, you don't have to study it a whole lot.

the bare minimum (at least for something like a romance language or similar) is:

- to understand how to tell the subject, verb, and object apart
- to understand conjugation enough to begin to pick out verb tenses.

> spend as little time as you need to on grammar.

## vocab

### most common words

### sentence mining
