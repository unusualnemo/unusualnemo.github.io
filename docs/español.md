## resources

### listening

- [diana uribe](https://open.spotify.com/show/3xIalu2XhZ2EjSbOcTg0U8) - podcast
	- diana has a clear, consistent voice and is very nice to listen to, even if you don't know all the words
	- a colombian accent, the accent i'm aiming for
	- also, the podcast has a format where it focuses on one subject per episode, so you hear the same words throughout an episode, typically

### reading (and listening along)

- crepúsculo (twilight)
	- [crepúsculo libro](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8_X3Z65v7lhV3hsd2swOURGMGc/view?resourcekey=0-Genf9D4qt-Vog07uIQfwxw) - the book
	- [crepúsculo audiolibro](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYgyBEdg-xFZafIVqcEgcahLkUZhkZMf) - the audiobook
	- a book i read a couple times in high school, it's pretty popular so it was easy to find materials in latin american spanish

### watching

- [31 minutos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVI9tQggdGtFXgCwpjTM_d2pdH6ABeRFL) - a free show on youtube
	- really funny even without knowing all the words
	- made for kids so very simple, common vocab
	- the downside is that it sometimes uses chilean slang that can be difficult to look up
- los espookies - another comedy show
	- also very funny
	- fun characters
	- short enough episodes

### grammar

i enjoy both of these because they focus on transferring your knowledge of your first language to your second.

- [language transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org/) - a podcast
- madrigal's magic key to spanish - a book

see [[language learning#grammar|here]] for more about grammar study.
