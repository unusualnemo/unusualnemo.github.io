## resources

### listening

- [diana uribe ->](https://open.spotify.com/show/3xIalu2XhZ2EjSbOcTg0U8) - podcast
	- diana has a clear, consistent voice and is very nice to listen to, even if you don't know all the words
	- a colombian accent, the accent i'm aiming for
	- also, the podcast has a format where it focuses on one subject per episode, so you hear the same words throughout an episode, typically

### reading (and listening along)

- crepúsculo (twilight)
	- [crepúsculo libro ->](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8_X3Z65v7lhV3hsd2swOURGMGc/view?resourcekey=0-Genf9D4qt-Vog07uIQfwxw) - the book
	- [crepúsculo audiolibro ->](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYgyBEdg-xFZafIVqcEgcahLkUZhkZMf) - the audiobook
	- a book i read a couple times in high school, it's pretty popular so it was easy to find materials in latin american spanish

### watching

- [31 minutos ->](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVI9tQggdGtFXgCwpjTM_d2pdH6ABeRFL) - a free show on youtube
	- really funny even without knowing all the words
	- made for kids so very simple, common vocab
	- the downside is that it sometimes uses chilean slang that can be difficult to look up
- los espookies - another comedy show
	- also very funny
	- fun characters
	- short enough episodes

### grammar

i enjoy both of these because they focus on transferring your knowledge of your first language to your second.

- [language transfer ->](https://www.languagetransfer.org/) - a podcast
- madrigal's magic key to spanish - a book

see [[=language learning notes#grammar]] for more about grammar study.

## cheating at conjugation

it's very useful for most sentences, especially future tense

but it doesn't work in all cases, especially the past tense

- past tense
	- 'he comido'
	- i have eaten
- present tense
	- 'estoy comiendo'
	- i am eating
- future tense
	- 'voy a comer'
	- i am going to eat
- only have to learn how to form participles

## trilled r

> i'm still not good at these, but people learn better from amateurs than from experts so i'll note the things that have helped me

the spanish *r* is so close to a *d* sound. i've heard that it was close to a *z* or a *ts* sound, but those are lies, it's a *d* sound.

because it's a *d* sound i've found that the '*pdince of pdussia*' mantra worked the best.

i also didn't feel like '*erre con erre*' was helpful. i think it was because there's not a lot of airflow in *erre*.

as opposed to words beginning with *j* or *c* like *jarritos* or *jarra*/*jarro* or *cerradura* that lead into the *rr* with a lot of airflow.
