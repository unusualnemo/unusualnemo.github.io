- he was found with stone and natural-fiber tools
	- 6-foot longbow
	- deerskin case
	- fourteen arrows
	- a stick with an antler tip for sharpening flint blades
	- a small flint dagger in a woven sheath
	- a copper axe
	- a medicine bag
- believed to have been killed by another human
	- arrowhead in his left shoulder and other wounds
- he had 61 tattoos?!
	- they may have been for pain relief?? like acupuncture, that's incredible
