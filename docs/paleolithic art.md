- artwork means that they had an interest in sharing knowledge (reminds me that [[other animals can't teach]]), expressing feelings, and transmitting knowledge to later generations
- artwork from over 35 tya exists, but is rare
- portable figurines have also been found
	- many have finely carved facial features
	- some have exaggerated sexual organs and butts, like the venus below
