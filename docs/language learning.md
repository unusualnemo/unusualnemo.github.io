## language acquisition

'acquiring' language is different from 'studying' a language. this method of acquiring a language tries to copy how most people learned their first language:

>get as much comprehensible input as possible and let your brain do the pattern recognition that it's so good at.

the major difference that this method has to other methods of learning a language is that there is zero emphasis on attempting to speak the language.

>[!NOTE]
>my personal opinion is to speak as much as is fun for you. if you naturally translate in your head, go ahead! don't worry about breaking those rules. i find that the more flashcards i do, the more i start associating things in my every day with the language that i'm learning.
>
>i find that speaking a little can also be motivating. it really sucks to be studying a language for a while and still not be able to say even the simplest things in that language. speaking a little and being able to communicate something with someone can also signal to the brain that what you're learning is useful and can help you focus on it when you need to.

the minimal [[active study in language learning|studying]] you do do will be only enough to begin understanding what you're hearing in your [[types of immersion|immersion]].
