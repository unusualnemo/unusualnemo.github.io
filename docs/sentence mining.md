take sentences out of your [[immersion#active|active immersion]] and make them into flashcards

the card should look something like this...

> Me gustan las ==**carreras**== de caballos.
> --
> I like horse ==**races**==.

... with one unknown word bolded and/or highlighted in the target-language sentence, as well as the corresponding natural-language sentence.

that one, highlighted word is the word you'll be studying

## picking words and sentences

### pick easy words

- prioritize words that feel familiar
	- when you keep seeing the same words again and again, that's a good indicator that they are common and therefore useful
	- a lot of the time your immersion material will use the same words over and over depending on the genre/themes
- choose words that seem accessible and useful
	- choose concrete words over words with abstract/vague definitions
- prioritize words that are relevant to you
	- these will be easier to memorize and more useful whenever you start using them

### pick easy sentences

- prioritize straightforward sentences with simple grammar
- prioritize sentences in which you know most of the words
	- preferably you will know all but one word, the word that you are studying from the card
- you don't have to use the entire sentence; you can break it into a smaller complete phrase
