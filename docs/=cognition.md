## attention

- pomodoro
- focused vs. diffused
- multitasking
- increasing focus

## language

[[=language learning]]

## memory

- dual-process theory
	- chunking
- focused vs diffused mode
	- dali and edison
	- what are they? what's the difference
	- how do you get into the diffused mode?
- types
	- short-term memory vs. long-term memory
	- working memory
	- declarative vs. procedural
- health
	- sleep ([[=health#sleep]])
	- stress
	- diet
	- exercise
	- socializing
- notetaking
	- taking notes in your own words
	- concept-based notes
	- mind-mapping
- [[interleaving]]
	- allows for cross-disipline pattern and analogy building
- memory_training
	- mnemonics
	- memory palace
	- major system
- deliberate practice
- metaphor, story, and visualization
- desirable difficulty
- [[flashcards]]
	- the testing effect
		- summative tests vs. formative tests
			- summative tests (like standardized tests, sats, and iq tests) are designed to quantify 'intelligence' at a fixed point in time and do nothing to help the test-taker learn
				- also these tests usually come with incredibly high stakes, tempting cheating (not only from students, but also from teachers)
					- reminds me of that huge testing scandal in china: [[weapons of math destruction]]
			- formative tests (like [[flashcards]] and quizzes) test on specific areas of knowledge and assist the test-taker by [[exposing gaps in knowledge]] and strengthening what they do know through active recall
				- formative testing should be done often throughout learning
					- this discourages cramming at the end of the unit/semester/year
				- information is retained for much longer, allowing for cross-disipline pattern and analogy building, like in [[interleaving]]
				- my thoughts: grading these assessments sabotages their usefulness; students should be taught that finding and working on your weak spots is good, not something to be dreaded
	- active recall
		- pulling info out of your brain strengthens the relevant connections in your brain
	- the forgetting curve
	- spaced repetition
	- anki and the [20 rules of formulating knowledge in learning ->](http://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm)
- elaboration/learning by teaching
	- examples
		- feynman technique
		- rubber duck debugging
		- "if you can’t explain it to a 6-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself"
	- why does this work?
		- active recall
		- taking notes in your own words
		- it helps in [[exposing gaps in knowledge]]
			- when you come up against a wall in your explanation (and you will), that's what you need to study further
