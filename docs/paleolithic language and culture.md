[[_paleolithic]]

- language may be the most important innovation of the paleolithic era
- we believe that they had language because a lot of the stuff they did would be theoretically impossible without it
	- migration across huge distances
	- settlements
	- tools
	- trade
	- social structures
	- cultures (morality, spirituality, meaning-making)
- looking at the skulls of these people, we see indentations that imply the development of brain areas associated with speech
- we still don't know how they developed speech
