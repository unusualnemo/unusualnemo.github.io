from: [intro to the imaginary numbers from khan academy ->](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:complex/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:imaginary/a/intro-to-the-imaginary-numbers)

this may seem weird, but it is actually very common for equations to be unsolvable in one number system but solvable in another, more general number system.

here are some examples with which you might be more familiar.

- with only the counting numbers, we can't solve $x+8=1$; we need the integers for this!
- with only the integers, we can't solve $3x - 1 = 0$; we need the rational numbers for this!
- with only the rational numbers, we can't solve $x^2 = 2$. enter the irrational numbers and the real number system!

and so, with only the real numbers, we can't solve $x^2 = -1$. we need the [[imaginary numbers]] for this!
