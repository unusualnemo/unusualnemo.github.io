it is actually very common for equations to be unsolvable in one number system but solvable in another, more general number system.

- with only the counting numbers, we can't solve $x+8=1$; we need the integers for this
- with only the integers, we can't solve $3x - 1 = 0$; we need the rational numbers for this
- with only the rational numbers, we can't solve $x^2 = 2$. enter the irrational numbers and the real number system
- with only the real numbers, we can't solve $x^2$=âˆ’1. we need the imaginary numbers for this
