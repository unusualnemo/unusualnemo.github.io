## basic stuff

sometimes i forget the simplest term and i have to look it up, so i put those things here

### natural numbers

- non-negative, whole numbers
- sometimes includes zero, sometimes doesn't
- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...

### whole number

- positive integer
- 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...

### integers

- all whole numbers
	- plus negative numbers
	- also includes zero
	- no fractions/decimals
- ... -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 ...

### irrational number

- number that cannot be represented as a decimal or fraction

### real numbers

- numbers that are not imaginary
- ... -3 ... -2.5 ... -1 ... 0 ... .1 ... $\frac{1}{2}$ ... 2 ... $\pi$ ...
	- there are an infinite amount of numbers between these numbers

### complex number

- a number that includes real numbers and imaginary numbers
- $3i + 2$, $i\sqrt{3} - 5$

### fractions

#### mixed numbers

- whole numbers mixed with fractions or decimals
- $1.5$
- $1 \frac{1}{2}$

#### denominator and numerator

- numerator - top number in a fraction
- denominator - bottom number in a fraction

#### proper fraction

- a fraction whose denominator is greater than its numerator

### simplifying radicals

$$
\sqrt{44} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{11} = 2\sqrt{11}
$$

### algebra

#### binomials

$2x^2+1$

$$
2x^2+1
$$

- 2 terms
- exponent must be a non-negative integer
- (also: trinomial, quartic, quintic, etc...)

#### polynomials

$$
2x^2+3x-4
$$

- terms are separated by pluses and minuses
	- comprised of coefficients, variables, and exponents
- the *degree* of the polynomial refers to the biggest exponent
- the *leading coefficient* is the coefficient in front of the biggest exponent
- exponents must be non-negative integers
