oakley, relating to the diffused mode/focused mode stuff) that you have to treat the writing and the editing as separate tasks. don't edit yourself while you are writing! writing corresponds to the diffused mode and editing corresponds to the focused mode. maybe i need to approach my note taking like that? separating the writing down of notes with the editing them into a more readable format?

take a picture of handmade mind maps? do i make hand made maps into mermaid graphs? do i just use outlines to recreate hand made maps and remove that localizing effect, but maybe it's more readable?
